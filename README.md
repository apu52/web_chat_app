# Apertre NextJS Project

This Next.js project is dedicated to creating a dashboard based on a Figma design file. The dashboard design is available in a Figma community file, which you can access [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1098131983383434513).

## Project Overview

The Apertre NextJS Project is all about bringing a Figma design to life by developing a functional and responsive dashboard. Here are the key features and goals of this project:

- **Dashboard Design**: The project is centered around the design provided in the Figma file, ensuring that the final product closely resembles the provided design.

- **Next.js**: This project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, which provides server-side rendering and other performance benefits. It is a great choice for creating web applications.

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard will be designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience for all users.

- **Data Integration**: Depending on the project requirements, you might need to integrate real data or mock data to populate the dashboard with information.

- **Modular Components**: The project will be structured into reusable components, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
